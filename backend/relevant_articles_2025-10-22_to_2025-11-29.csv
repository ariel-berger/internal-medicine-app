41159885,Deferring Arterial Catheterization in Critically Ill Patients with Shock.,"BACKGROUND: In patients with shock, whether noninvasive blood-pressure monitoring is an effective alternative to the recommended use of an arterial catheter is uncertain.  METHODS: In this multicenter, open-label, noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned patients who had shock and had been admitted to an intensive care unit within the past 24 hours to receive early insertion (<4 hours after randomization) of an arterial catheter (invasive strategy) or to be monitored with an automated brachial cuff (noninvasive strategy). Insertion of an arterial catheter was allowed later in patients assigned to the noninvasive-strategy group who met prespecified safety criteria. The primary outcome was death from any cause at day 28 (noninferiority margin, 5 percentage points). Adverse events of special interest related to the blood-pressure-monitoring device that was used were recorded, as was patient-reported pain or discomfort related to the ongoing presence of the device.  RESULTS: A total of 1010 patients underwent randomization; 504 patients assigned to the noninvasive-strategy group and 502 assigned to the invasive-strategy group were included in the analyses. A total of 74 patients (14.7%) in the noninvasive-strategy group and 493 (98.2%) in the invasive-strategy group underwent insertion of an arterial catheter. Death within 28 days occurred in 173 patients (34.3%) in the noninvasive-strategy group and 185 (36.9%) in the invasive-strategy group (adjusted risk difference, -3.2 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -8.9 to 2.5; P = 0.006 for noninferiority). Results of per-protocol analyses were similar in the two groups. A total of 66 patients (13.1%) in the noninvasive-strategy group and 45 (9.0%) in the invasive-strategy group had at least 1 day of pain or discomfort related to the ongoing presence of the blood-pressure-monitoring device. Hematoma or hemorrhage related to the arterial catheter occurred in 5 patients (1.0%) in the noninvasive-strategy group and 41 patients (8.2%) in the invasive-strategy group.  CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with shock, results for death from any cause at day 28 indicated that management without early arterial catheter insertion was noninferior to early catheter insertion.

41159835,Personalized Hemodynamic Resuscitation Targeting Capillary Refill Time in Early Septic Shock: The ANDROMEDA-SHOCK-2 Randomized Clinical Trial.,"IMPORTANCE: The optimal strategy for hemodynamic resuscitation in early septic shock remains uncertain.  OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of a personalized hemodynamic resuscitation protocol targeting capillary refill time (CRT-PHR) on a hierarchical composite outcome of mortality, duration of vital support, and length of hospital stay.  DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted in 86 centers in 19 countries. Patients within the first 4 hours of septic shock were included between March 2022 and April 2025, with last follow-up in July 2025.  INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to undergo CRT-PHR (n = 720), including assessment of pulse pressure, diastolic arterial pressure, fluid responsiveness, and bedside echocardiography, to tailor fluids, vasopressors, and inotropes, vs usual care (n = 747).  MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a hierarchical composite of mortality, duration of vital support (vasoactives, mechanical ventilation, and kidney replacement therapy), and length of hospital stay assessed at 28 days. A win ratio was calculated for the primary outcome by comparing all possible patient pairs, starting with the first event in the hierarchy and stratified by median APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) II score at admission. Secondary outcomes were mortality, vital support-free days, and length of hospital stay at 28 days.  RESULTS: From 1501 randomized patients, 1467 were included in the primary analysis (mean age, 66 [17] years; 43.3% female). There were 131 131 wins (48.9%) in the CRT-PHR group vs 112 787 (42.1%) in the usual care group for the hierarchical composite primary outcome, with a win ratio of 1.16 (95% CI, 1.02-1.33; P = .04). Individual wins for death were 19.1% vs 17.8%; duration of vital support, 26.4% vs 21.1%; and length of hospital stay, 3.4% vs 3.2% in the intervention vs usual care groups, respectively.  CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with early septic shock, a personalized hemodynamic resuscitation protocol targeting capillary refill time was superior to usual care for the primary composite outcome, primarily due to a lower duration of vital support.

41159889,A Pragmatic Trial of Glucocorticoids for Community-Acquired Pneumonia.,"BACKGROUND: Adjunctive glucocorticoids may reduce mortality among patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in well-resourced settings. Whether these drugs are beneficial in low-resource settings with limited diagnostic and treatment facilities is unclear.  METHODS: In this pragmatic, open-label, randomized, controlled trial conducted in 18 public hospitals in Kenya, we assigned adult patients who had received a diagnosis of CAP and who did not have a clear indication for glucocorticoids to receive either standard care for CAP or oral low-dose glucocorticoids for 10 days in addition to standard care. The primary outcome was death from any cause at 30 days after enrollment.  RESULTS: A total of 2180 patients underwent randomization (1089 assigned to the glucocorticoid group and 1091 to the standard-care group). The median age of the patients was 53 years (interquartile range, 38 to 72); 46% were women. At day 30, deaths were reported in 530 patients (24.3%): 246 patients (22.6%) in the glucocorticoid group and 284 patients (26.0%) in the standard-care group (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.73 to 0.97; P = 0.02). The frequencies of adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in the two trial groups. Serious adverse events that were considered to be related to glucocorticoid administration occurred in 5 patients (0.5%).  CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CAP in a low-resource setting, adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy was associated with a lower risk of death than standard care.

41159812,Sodium Bicarbonate for Severe Metabolic Acidemia and Acute Kidney Injury: The BICARICU-2 Randomized Clinical Trial.,"IMPORTANCE: The effect of sodium bicarbonate infusion on outcome in patients with severe metabolic acidemia and moderate to severe acute kidney injury is unknown.  OBJECTIVE: To determine whether sodium bicarbonate infusion is associated with day 90 all-cause mortality in patients with severe metabolic acidemia and moderate to severe acute kidney injury.  DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, open-label, clinical trial conducted with 640 patients in 43 French intensive care units from October 6, 2019, to December 19, 2023, with 90-day follow-up. The last date of follow-up was June 17, 2024. Adults with severe metabolic acidemia (defined as pH ≤7.20) and moderate to severe acute kidney injury were enrolled.  INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either intravenous sodium bicarbonate infusion or no sodium bicarbonate to target an arterial pH of 7.30 or higher.  MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was day 90 all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included day 28 and day 180 all-cause mortality; use of organ support therapy, vasopressors, or invasive mechanical ventilation; intensive care unit and hospital length of stay; intensive care unit-acquired infections; fluid balance; day-7 Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment score (6 organ systems' function is evaluated and scored from 0 [no dysfunction] to 4 [failure]; total score ranges from 0 [normal] to 24 [maximum failure]); and major adverse kidney events on day 90.  RESULTS: Among 640 randomly assigned patients, 627 were analyzed (313 in the control group and 314 in the bicarbonate group). The median age was 67 years (IQR, 59-74 years); 194 of 314 patients (62%) in the bicarbonate group and 185 of 313 controls (59%) were male. In the primary analysis, day 90 all-cause mortality was 195 of 314 patients (62.1%) in the bicarbonate group and 193 of 313 (61.7%) in the control group (absolute difference, 0.4; 95% CI, -7.2 to 8.0; P = .91). There was no evidence of a group effect on day 28 or day 180 all-cause mortality. Among 18 secondary outcomes, kidney replacement therapy was used in 109 of 314 (35%) bicarbonate group patients and 157 of 313 (50%) controls (absolute difference, -15.5; 95% CI, -23.1 to -7.8). No evidence of a group effect was found on other secondary outcomes, including adverse events.

41122847,Bailout Intracranial Angioplasty or Stenting After Thrombectomy for Acute Large Vessel Occlusion: 1-Year Outcomes of ANGEL-REBOOT.,"BACKGROUND: The long-term benefits of bailout intracranial angioplasty or stenting (BAOS) after thrombectomy in patients with acute large vessel occlusion remain unclear. This study compared BAOS with standard therapy in patients with large vessel occlusion with unsuccessful recanalization (expanded Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction score 0-2a) or >70% residual stenosis after thrombectomy.  METHODS: ANGEL-REBOOT (Randomized Study of Bailout Intracranial Angioplasty Following Thrombectomy for Acute Large Vessel Occlusion) was a multicenter, open-label, blinded-end point, randomized trial conducted across 36 Chinese hospitals. Patients ≥18 years of age with anterior or posterior circulation large vessel occlusion within 24 hours of stroke onset were enrolled. After identification of thrombectomy failure or high-grade residual stenosis, patients were randomly assigned to the BAOS group (intervention) or the standard therapy group (control), in which thrombectomy was continued or terminated. The use of tirofiban was permitted in both groups during and after the procedure. In the intention-to-treat population, the primary outcome was analyzed using an assumption-free ordinal analysis (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test) to compare the modified Rankin Scale scores (ordinal variable ranging from 0 to 6) between groups at 1-year follow-up, from which the generalized odds ratio was derived. Secondary outcomes included stroke recurrence in the treated artery and all-cause mortality within 1 year, analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models.  RESULTS: A total of 348 patients were randomly assigned (176 to the BAOS group and 172 to the standard therapy group) and followed for 90 days, from December 19, 2021, to June 2, 2023. Of these, 326 patients (166 in the BAOS group and 160 in the standard therapy group) completed the 1-year follow-up. Compared with standard therapy, BAOS significantly improved the 1-year modified Rankin Scale score distribution (generalized odds ratio, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.05-1.73];   CONCLUSIONS: Among Chinese patients with large vessel occlusion with unsuccessful recanalization or high-grade residual stenosis after thrombectomy, BAOS was associated with reduced disability and stroke recurrence after 1 year compared with standard therapy.

40838822,Acute heart failure in non-cardiac surgery.,"More than 64 million people worldwide have heart failure (HF), and these numbers are expected to rise. Acute HF (AHF) is the leading cause of hospitalization in patients over 65 years old and is linked to high mortality and readmission rates. AHF may also be a frequent complication in patients hospitalized for other medical reasons as well as after cardiac or non-cardiac surgery. These three entities are summarized as secondary AHF. As secondary AHF has been largely overlooked by medical research and education, little is known about its pathophysiology, phenotypes, diagnosis, management, and prognosis. Secondary AHF occurring after non-cardiac surgery warrants particular attention due to its very high mortality rates of up to 44% within 1 year and is therefore the focus of this review. The scope of this document is to summarize the available evidence regarding the pathophysiology, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of AHF after non-cardiac surgery. Key to prevention is understanding and addressing the pathophysiology of AHF after non-cardiac surgery, which involves close monitoring of fluid status to avoid volume overload and/or hypovolemia, avoiding hypo- and/or hypertension, treating pain and anaemia to prevent tachycardia, and avoiding electrolyte disturbances to prevent arrhythmias. Cardiac biomarkers, such as cardiac troponins and natriuretic peptides, serve as important diagnostic tools and enhance risk stratification in the perioperative setting. A low threshold to perform echocardiography in this population is suggested. Vigilant post-operative care is essential for the early recognition and treatment of AHF after non-cardiac surgery, which could help improve outcomes for patients.",European heart journal,Danielle M Gualandro; Josep Masip; Sigrun Halvorsen; Susanna Price; Xavier Rosselló; Ovidiu Chioncel; W Frank Peacock; Òscar Miró; Mucio Tavares Oliveira Junior; Alexandre Mebazaa; Elke Platz; Offer Amir; Hannah Schaubroeck; Johannes Grand; Alessandro Sionis; Guido Tavazzi; Janine Pöss; Frederik H Verbrugge; Alessia Gambaro; Otilia Tica; Mattia Arrigo; Christian Mueller,2025-10-22,10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf559,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40838822/,Cardiology,,Acute heart failure; Heart failure; Natriuretic peptides; Non-cardiac surgery; Perioperative complications,"Humans; Heart Failure; Acute Disease; Postoperative Complications; Prognosis; Biomarkers; Risk Factors; Aged; Surgical Procedures, Operative",Journal Article; Review,9,"This review article examines acute heart failure (AHF) occurring after non-cardiac surgery, a condition associated with mortality rates up to 44% within 1 year.

41159880,Selective Decontamination of the Digestive Tract during Ventilation in the ICU.,"BACKGROUND: Whether selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) reduces mortality among patients undergoing mechanical ventilation and whether it adversely affects microbial ecology in the intensive care unit (ICU) remain unclear. In an earlier analysis of data from Australia, SDD did not result in a lower incidence of in-hospital death than standard care, but data from the full international trial are needed.  METHODS: We randomly assigned ICUs in Australia and Canada to use SDD or to continue standard care for two 12-month periods in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. Patients in the SDD group received specific oral and gastric antimicrobial interventions for the duration of ventilation and an intravenous antibiotic agent for the first 4 days after enrollment. All other patients in the ICU were included in an observational ecologic assessment. Previously reported data from Australia are now combined with data from Canada. The primary outcome was in-hospital death from any cause at 90 days. The secondary clinical outcomes, assessed at 90 days, were death in the ICU and the number of days alive and free of mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and hospitalization. Microbiologic secondary outcomes included new positive cultures for bloodstream infections and antibiotic-resistant organisms. For the ecologic assessment, the microbiologic outcomes were tested for noninferiority (noninferiority margin, 2 percentage points).  RESULTS: In this trial involving 20,000 patients in 26 ICUs, 9289 patients were enrolled in the randomized trial and 10,711 were included in the ecologic assessment. At 90 days, 1175 of 4215 patients (27.9%) in the SDD group and 1494 of 5065 (29.5%) in the standard-care group had died before hospital discharge (odds ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 1.05; P = 0.27). New bloodstream infections occurred in 4.9% of the patients in the SDD group and in 6.8% of those in the standard-care group (adjusted mean difference, -1.30 percentage points; 95% CI, -2.55 to -0.05); antibiotic-resistant organisms were cultured in 16.8% and 26.8%, respectively (adjusted mean difference, -9.60 percentage points; 95% CI, -12.40 to -6.80). In the ecologic assessment, noninferiority of SDD was not confirmed for the development of new antibiotic-resistant organisms. Adverse events considered to be related to SDD or standard care were reported in 12 patients (0.3%) in the SDD group and in no patients in the standard-care group. Serious adverse events occurred in 47 patients (1.1%) and 59 patients (1.2%), respectively.  CONCLUSIONS: Among critically ill patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, SDD did not result in a lower incidence of in-hospital death than standard care.

41150941,Stratified treatment of myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries: the PROMISE trial.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) is associated with a significant risk of mortality, rehospitalisation, and angina burden. Despite its clinical impact, no randomized clinical trials have hitherto evaluated optimal management strategy for MINOCA. The PROMISE trial was designed to assess whether a stratified treatment improves clinical outcomes in patients with MINOCA as compared to standard care.  METHODS: PROMISE is a multicentre randomised trial. Patients with MINOCA were randomised 1:1 to either a stratified treatment based on a comprehensive diagnostic workup aimed at identifying the underlying aetiology, or to standard care. The primary endpoint was the between-group difference in the change in angina status at 12 months, assessed by the Seattle Angina Questionnaire summary score (SAQSS). The secondary endpoint was the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as the composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization and repeated coronary angiography. The trial was terminated early upon recommendation by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board due to clear benefits observed in the intervention group and potential harm in the control group.  RESULTS: Of 101 randomized patients, 92 were confirmed as MINOCA and included in the final analysis (mean age 62±13 years, 48% women; stratified treatment n=45; standard care n=47). At 12-month follow-up, SAQSS was significantly higher in the stratified treatment than in standard care group, with a mean between-group difference of +9.38 in favour of the stratified treatment (95% confidence interval 6.81 to 11.95; p<0.001).

41162680,Single Health System RCT Addressing Corticosteroid Injection Use in Treating Adults with ARTIs.,"BACKGROUND: Systemic corticosteroids are frequently used inappropriately to treat patients with acute respiratory tract illnesses (ARTI) despite a lack of efficacy and risks.  OBJECTIVE: To develop an intervention which effectively decreases corticosteroid use for ARTI encounters among outpatient clinicians.  DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial in which the clinicians in primary care clinics that were randomized to intervention clinics were compared to clinicians in control group clinics. The 6-month trial began in March 2023.  SETTING: Outpatient primary care clinics within Southeast Louisiana.  PARTICIPANTS: High steroid utilizing clinicians with ≥5% baseline ARTI steroid injection rate caring for outpatient adults.  INTERVENTION: Intervention clinicians were assigned a voluntary 1-h online course and received a monthly personalized report of their steroid usage.  MAIN MEASURE: Monthly office visits with at least one ARTI diagnosis were evaluated for the rate of corticosteroid injection use. The effect of the intervention was assessed by a negative binomial regression model accounting for the repeated nature of the data collection.  KEY RESULTS: Sixty-one clinicians in the control clinic group and 75 in the intervention clinic group were identified as high-utilizing clinicians. At baseline, intervention and control clinicians' average inappropriate steroid injection rates were similar: 16 and 15%, respectively. Steroid injection use among intervention clinicians decreased significantly compared to controlled clinicians (5.5 (95% CI 3.8, 7.9) vs. 10.7 (95% CI 7.7, 14.8) per 100 patients; p = 0.03) - resulting in nearly a 50% reduction in inappropriate use.

41077049,"Sultiame once per day in obstructive sleep apnoea (FLOW): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding, phase 2 trial.","BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is highly prevalent but approved pharmacological treatment options are missing. Sultiame improves the ventilatory response and upper airway muscle activity by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase. This study aimed to prospectively assess the efficacy and safety of three dosages of sultiame in OSA.  METHODS: This multicentre, randomised, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding, phase 2 trial was performed at 28 hospitals and community-based sites in five European countries. Adults (aged 18-75 years) with untreated, moderate to severe OSA and an Apnoea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) of ≥15 to ≤50 events per h were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1), using interactive response technology, to receive placebo or sultiame 100 mg, 200 mg, or 300 mg tablets of identical appearance once per day at bedtime for 15 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by baseline AHI3a. The primary outcome measure for efficacy was the relative change of AHI3a from baseline to week 15 (scheduled treatment end). All participants who were randomly assigned were included in the primary efficacy analysis using an estimands framework and in the safety analysis. This trial is registered with EudraCT (2021-002926-26) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05236842) and is complete.  FINDINGS: Between Dec 2, 2021, and April 8, 2023, 535 patients were screened and 298 were randomly assigned to placebo (n=75), or sultiame 100 mg (n=74), 200 mg (n=74), or 300 mg (n=75). 240 patients completed 15 weeks of treatment. 220 (74%) of 298 participants were male and 78 (26%) were female. In the full analysis set, placebo-subtracted relative AHI3a adjusted means change at week 15 was -16·4% (95% CI -31·3 to -1·4; p=0·032), -30·2% (-45·4 to -15·1; p<0·0001), and 34·6% (-49·1 to -20·0; p<0·0001) for sultiame 100 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg, respectively. The incidence of adverse events increased dose-dependently: 46 (61%) of 75 patients in the placebo group, 54 (73%) of 74 in the 100 mg group, 62 (84%) of 74 in the 200 mg group, and 68 (91%) of 75 in the 300 mg group. Events reported in more than 10% of patients in the placebo, 100 mg, 200 mg, or 300 mg groups were paraesthesia (seven [9%] of 75, 16 [22%] of 74, 32 [43%] of 74, 43 [57%] of 75), headache (six [8%], five [7%], 12 [16%], 11 [15%]), COVID-19 (three [4%], three [4%], six [8%], ten [13%]), and nasopharyngitis (nine [12%], three [4%], seven [9%], seven [9%]).

41132135,Effectiveness of Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir or Molnupiravir Use in Immunocompromised Patients on B-Cell-Depleting Therapy With COVID-19: A Target Trial Emulation Study.,"BACKGROUND: Immunocompromised patients, especially those receiving B-cell-depleting therapy (BCDT), remain at high risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although monoclonal antibodies showed benefit pre-Omicron, the real-world effectiveness of the oral antivirals in BCDT recipients is unclear.  METHODS: We emulated a target trial using the Cleveland Clinic electronic health record. Adult patients (≥18 years) with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases who received rituximab or ocrelizumab and tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 between 19 December 2021 and 30 June 2025 were eligible. The primary endpoint was hospitalization or death within 21 days; the secondary endpoint was death within 90 days. Propensity scores adjusted for confounding, and Weighted Cox regression models were used to evaluated treatment effects.  RESULTS: Among 255 853 COVID-19 cases, 876 met criteria for the nirmatrelvir/ritonavir cohort (411 treated, 465 untreated) and 566 for the molnupiravir cohort (91 treated, 475 untreated). In the nirmatrelvir/ritonavir cohort, 18 (4.4%) of treated versus 43 (9.2%) of untreated patients were hospitalized or died within 21 days. After weighting, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir reduced the hazard by 44% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI],  0.31-0.99). In the molnupiravir cohort, 6 (6.6%) of treated and 46 (9.7%) of untreated patients met the primary endpoint; the weighted HR was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.24-1.33), not statistically significant.  CONCLUSIONS: Early outpatient nirmatrelvir/ritonavir significantly lowers the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death in patients on BCDT.

41159833,Development and Validation of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)-2 Score.,"IMPORTANCE: Acute dysfunction of vital organs is the hallmark of critical illness. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, the most widely adopted approach to describe organ dysfunction, has not been updated in 30 years and therefore may not appropriately capture current clinical practice and outcomes.  OBJECTIVES: To inform the data-driven component of an updated score (SOFA-2) in varied geographical and resource settings (stages 6-8) after expert input via a modified Delphi process (stages 1-5).  DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A federated analysis was performed on data collected from adult patients admitted to 1319 intensive care units (ICUs) in 9 countries (Australia, Austria, Brazil, France, Italy, Japan, Nepal, New Zealand, United States) between 2014 and 2023. Four representative multicenter cohorts containing data from 2 098 356 patients were used for data-driven score development and internal validation. External validation was performed on 6 cohorts containing data from 1 241 114 patients.  MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Content validity for organ dysfunction identified through the modified Delphi process should be reflected by predictive validity using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of the score measured on the first ICU day (higher scores indicate worse organ dysfunction).  RESULTS: Of 3.34 million patient encounters, 270 108 (8.1%) died in the ICU (range, 4.5% to 20.5% across the 10 cohorts). SOFA-2 modified the 6 organ systems of the original SOFA score (brain, respiratory, cardiovascular, liver, kidney, hemostasis), including new variables and revised thresholds that better describe the organ dysfunction distribution from 0 to 4 points and their associated mortality (SOFA-2 AUROC, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.76-0.81; SOFA-1 AUROC, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.74-0.81). Evaluation of sequential SOFA-2 data from ICU day 1 to day 7 maintained its predictive validity. Insufficient data and lack of content validity precluded incorporation of gastrointestinal and immune dysfunction scores into SOFA-2.

40864014,Effect of Intensive Blood Pressure Control on Stroke: A Prespecified Secondary Analysis of the ESPRIT Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) accounts for one-half of the population attributable fraction for stroke, so lowering SBP is the most important treatment for preventing stroke.  OBJECTIVES: In this study, the authors sought to assess the effects of intensive treatment targeting SBP <120 mm Hg on stroke compared with standard treatment targeting SBP <140 mm Hg.  METHODS: In the ESPRIT trial, hypertensive patients with high cardiovascular risk were randomly assigned to intensive treatment or standard treatment and followed for 3.4 years. We fitted Cox proportional hazards regression models to examine the effects on the incidence of stroke, one of the prespecified secondary outcomes. In addition, we performed post hoc analyses including effects on stroke subtypes and the landmark analyses about stroke and stroke subtypes.  RESULTS: We randomized 11,255 participants (3,022 with previous stroke). Their mean age was 64.6 ± 7.1 years, and 4,650 (41.3%) were female. During the follow-up, the mean SBP was 119.1 ± 11.1 mm Hg in the intensive arm and 134.8 ± 10.5 mm Hg in the standard arm. Stroke occurred in 262 participants (4.7%) in the intensive arm and 303 (5.4%) in the standard arm (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.73-1.02; P = 0.083), ischemic stroke in, respectively, 243 (4.3%) vs 261 (4.6%) (HR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.78-1.11; P = 0.423), and hemorrhagic stroke 23 (0.4%) vs 45 (0.8%) (HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.31-0.85; P = 0.009). Landmark analysis showed that the risk difference in stroke emerged after 1 year, and the HR for the period of longer than 1 year was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.60-0.94; P = 0.011). There were no interactions across all subgroups of baseline characteristics, including demographics, region, lifestyle, diastolic blood pressure, orthostatic hypotension, and comorbidities (all P interaction >0.05).  CONCLUSIONS: Compared with targeting <140 mm Hg, targeting <120 mm Hg halved the risk of hemorrhagic stroke and did not increase that of ischemic stroke.

The objective of this trial was to compare anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy for preventing device-related thrombosis (DRT) following LAAC.  METHODS: Prospective multicenter international randomized trial comparing 2 different antithrombotic strategies for preventing DRT following LAAC in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) or dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT, aspirin + clopidogrel) for 60 days. Patients had a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) at 60 days, and the images were analyzed in a central echocardiography laboratory by experienced echocardiographers blinded to the allocated treatment. The primary outcome was DRT as determined by TEE at 60 days after LAAC in those patients receiving the allocated treatment at the time of TEE (per-protocol analysis). The safety outcome included all-cause mortality, stroke, bleeding, or DRT (site-reported and leading to a treatment change) within 60 days after LAAC in all randomized patients (intention-to-treat analysis).  RESULTS: A total of 510 patients (mean age 77±9 years, 35% of women) were included between October 2018 and May 2025, and 253 and 257 patients were randomized to the DOAC and DAPT groups, respectively. Of these, 399 patients underwent TEE and were receiving the allocated treatment at 60 days post-LAAC. The primary outcome occurred in 3 patients (1.5%) in the DOAC group compared to 8 patients (4.1%) in the DAPT group (difference, -2.7% [95%CI, -6.0% to 0.6% ], p=0.110). The safety outcome occurred in 52 patients (22.5%) in the DOAC group compared to 82 patients (34.9%) in the DAPT group (difference, -12.4% [95% CI: -20.6% to -4.2%], p=0.003), and differences were mainly driven by a lower rate of bleeding events in the DOAC group (44 patients [17.4%] vs 64 patients [24.9%], difference, -7.5% [95% CI, -14.6% to -0.4%], p=0.038).  CONCLUSIONS: The use of DOAC after LAAC failed to reduce DRT compared to DAPT but it was associated with an improved safety profile.

41020514,Hypertonic Saline or Carbocisteine in Bronchiectasis.,"BACKGROUND: Bronchiectasis guidelines are inconsistent with regard to the effectiveness of mucoactive agents, and their use varies geographically. Large trials are needed to assess safety and effectiveness.  METHODS: For this open-label, randomized, two-by-two factorial trial at 20 sites in the United Kingdom, we enrolled participants with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis who had frequent pulmonary exacerbations and daily sputum production. Current smokers and persons who had recently received mucoactive treatments were excluded. All participants received standard care and were also assigned either to one of three mucoactive-drug groups - hypertonic saline (the hypertonic-saline group), hypertonic saline and carbocisteine (the combination group), or carbocisteine (the carbocisteine group) - or to standard care alone. The comparisons were between hypertonic saline and no hypertonic saline and between carbocisteine and no carbocisteine, with each category consisting of two groups. The primary outcome was the number of pulmonary exacerbations over a 52-week period. Key secondary outcomes were scores on disease-specific health-related quality-of-life assessments, time to next pulmonary exacerbation, and safety.  RESULTS: A total of 288 participants underwent randomization. No treatment interactions were found. The mean number of adjudicated fully qualifying pulmonary exacerbations over the 52-week period was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58 to 0.95) with hypertonic saline as compared with 0.98 (95% CI, 0.78 to 1.19) with no hypertonic saline (adjusted between-group difference in the means, -0.25 [95% CI, -0.57 to 0.07; P = 0.12]) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.66 to 1.06) with carbocisteine as compared with 0.90 (95% CI, 0.70 to 1.09) with no carbocisteine (adjusted between-group difference in the means, -0.04 [95% CI, -0.36 to 0.28; P = 0.81]).

40888725,Aspirin in Patients with Chronic Coronary Syndrome Receiving Oral Anticoagulation.,"BACKGROUND: The appropriate antithrombotic regimen for patients with chronic coronary syndrome who are at high atherothrombotic risk and receiving long-term oral anticoagulation remains unknown.  METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in France involving patients with chronic coronary syndrome who had undergone a previous stent implantation (>6 months before enrollment) and were at high atherothrombotic risk and currently receiving long-term oral anticoagulation. The patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive aspirin (100 mg once daily) or placebo; all the patients continued to receive their current oral anticoagulation therapy. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, systemic embolism, coronary revascularization, or acute limb ischemia. The key safety outcome was major bleeding.  RESULTS: A total of 872 patients underwent randomization; 433 were assigned to the aspirin group, and 439 to the placebo group. The trial was stopped early at the advice of the independent data and safety monitoring board after a median follow-up of 2.2 years because of an excess of deaths from any cause in the aspirin group. A primary efficacy outcome event occurred in 73 patients (16.9%) in the aspirin group and in 53 patients (12.1%) in the placebo group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07 to 2.18; P = 0.02). Death from any cause occurred in 58 patients (13.4%) in the aspirin group and in 37 (8.4%) in the placebo group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.14 to 2.58; P = 0.01). Major bleeding occurred in 44 patients (10.2%) in the aspirin group and in 15 patients (3.4%) in the placebo group (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.35; 95% CI, 1.87 to 6.00; P<0.001). A total of 467 and 395 serious adverse events were reported in the aspirin group and placebo group, respectively.  CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with chronic coronary syndrome at high atherothrombotic risk who were receiving an oral anticoagulant, the addition of aspirin led to a higher risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, systemic embolism, coronary revascularization, or acute limb ischemia than placebo, as well as higher risks of death from any cause and major bleeding.

40720119,Patent Foramen Ovale and Stroke: A Review.,"IMPORTANCE: A patent foramen ovale (PFO), an opening between the right and left atria during normal fetal development that fails to close after birth, is present in approximately 25% of all adults. Paradoxical embolism, a venous thromboembolism that travels to the systemic circulation typically through a PFO, accounts for about 5% of all strokes and 10% of strokes in younger patients.  OBSERVATIONS: Approximately 50% of patients 60 years or younger with an embolic stroke of undetermined source (cryptogenic stroke) have a PFO, compared with 25% of the general population. The Risk of Paradoxical Embolism (RoPE) score incorporates clinical characteristics (age, history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, cortical infarct on imaging) to predict the likelihood that embolic stroke of undetermined source was caused by a PFO. Among patients in the lowest RoPE score category (score <3), PFO prevalence was similar to that in the general population (23%), while PFO prevalence was 77% in patients with a RoPE score of 9 or 10. The PFO-Associated Stroke Causal Likelihood (PASCAL) classification system combines the RoPE score and anatomical criteria from echocardiography (large shunt, atrial septal aneurysm) to classify PFO as the ""probable,"" ""possible,"" or ""unlikely"" cause of otherwise cryptogenic stroke. PFO closure reduces recurrent ischemic stroke in patients 60 years or younger with cryptogenic stroke. In a pooled analysis of 6 trials (3740 patients), the annualized incidence of stroke over a median follow-up of 57 months was 0.47% (95% CI, 0.35%-0.65%) with PFO closure vs 1.09% (95% CI, 0.88%-1.36%) with medical therapy (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.28-0.60]). However, the benefits and harms of closure were highly heterogeneous across the trial populations. In patients categorized as PASCAL ""probable"" (ie, younger patients without vascular risk factors and high-risk PFO anatomical features), there was a 90% decreased relative rate of recurrent ischemic stroke after PFO closure at 2 years (hazard ratio, 0.10 [95% CI, 0.03-0.35]; absolute risk reduction, 2.1% [95% CI, 0.9%-3.4%]). PASCAL ""unlikely"" patients (eg, older patients with vascular risk factors and no high-risk PFO anatomical features) did not have a lower recurrent stroke rate with PFO closure but had higher risk of procedure- and device-related adverse events, such as atrial fibrillation.  CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patent foramen ovale is present in approximately 25% of all adults and is a common cause of stroke in young and middle-aged patients. The PASCAL classification system can help guide patient selection for PFO closure. Percutaneous PFO closure substantially reduces the risk of stroke recurrence in well-selected patients younger than 60 years after cryptogenic stroke.",JAMA,David M Kent; Andy Y Wang,2025-10-28,10.1001/jama.2025.10946,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40720119/,Neurology,,,"Humans; Foramen Ovale, Patent; Embolism, Paradoxical; Risk Factors; Stroke; Middle Aged; Embolic Stroke",Journal Article; Review,4,"This review summarizes evidence from 6 trials (3740 patients) showing that percutaneous PFO closure reduces recurrent ischemic stroke in patients ≤60 years with cryptogenic stroke, with annualized stroke incidence of 0.47% versus 1.09% with medical therapy (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.28-0.60) over median 57-month follow-up.

41025556,Sotatercept for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension within the First Year after Diagnosis.,"BACKGROUND: Sotatercept, an activin-signaling inhibitor, reduces morbidity and mortality among patients with long-standing pulmonary arterial hypertension. Its effects in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension within the first year after diagnosis are unclear.  METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we enrolled adult patients with World Health Organization functional class II or III pulmonary arterial hypertension who had received the diagnosis less than 1 year earlier, had an intermediate or high risk of death, and were receiving double or triple background therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive add-on therapy with subcutaneous sotatercept (starting dose, 0.3 mg per kilogram of body weight; escalated to target dose, 0.7 mg per kilogram) or placebo every 21 days. The primary end point was clinical worsening, a composite of death from any cause, unplanned hospitalization lasting at least 24 hours for worsening of pulmonary arterial hypertension, atrial septostomy, lung transplantation, or deterioration in performance in exercise testing due to pulmonary arterial hypertension, assessed in a time-to-first-event analysis.  RESULTS: The trial was stopped early owing to loss of clinical equipoise after the reporting of positive results from previous sotatercept trials. A total of 320 patients were included (160 each in the sotatercept and placebo groups). The median duration of follow-up was 13.2 months. At least one primary end-point event occurred in 17 patients (10.6%) in the sotatercept group and in 59 patients (36.9%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.41; P<0.001). Deterioration in performance in exercise testing due to pulmonary arterial hypertension occurred in 8 patients (5.0%) in the sotatercept group and in 46 patients (28.8%) in the placebo group; unplanned hospitalization for worsening of pulmonary arterial hypertension occurred in 3 patients (1.9%) and 14 patients (8.8%), respectively; and death from any cause occurred in 7 patients (4.4%) and 6 patients (3.8%). No cases of atrial septostomy or lung transplantation occurred. The most common adverse events with sotatercept were epistaxis (31.9%) and telangiectasia (26.2%).  CONCLUSIONS: Among adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension who had received the diagnosis less than 1 year earlier, the addition of sotatercept to background therapy resulted in a lower risk of clinical worsening than placebo.

We aimed to assess the association between NAs therapy and the risks of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Chinese chronic HBV infection individuals outside these criteria.  DESIGN: We analysed data from 30 784 chronic HBV infection individuals across 12 centres in China. We categorised individuals outside 2025 EASL strongly recommended treatment criteria into four groups: (1) hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive, high replicative (age <30, HBV DNA ≥8 log₁₀IU/mL, normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), no/mild fibrosis, no family history of liver cancer); (2) HBeAg-positive, impending phase transition (typically age ≥30, HBV DNA ≥6 log₁₀IU/mL, normal ALT, no advanced fibrosis); (3) HBeAg-negative, low replicative (HBV DNA <3.3 log₁₀IU/mL, normal ALT, no/mild fibrosis); (4) HBeAg-negative, high replicative, low-risk (HBV DNA 3.3-4.3 log₁₀IU/mL, normal ALT, no/mild fibrosis). The primary endpoints were the incidence of cirrhosis and HCC.  RESULTS: Up to 5 years of follow-up (117 814 person-years), we documented 635 incident cirrhosis and 164 HCC cases. In multivariable analyses, NA therapy significantly reduced risks of cirrhosis (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.32) and HCC (HR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.21) in Group 1, and cirrhosis (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.61) and HCC (HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.41) in Group 2. No significant associations were observed in Groups 3 and 4. Findings were consistent in propensity score matching analyses.

This analysis explores whether oHCM and mild symptoms patients experience similar clinical benefits with aficamten as patients with more advanced limitations.  METHODS: Patients in SEQUOIA-HCM (N = 282) were grouped at baseline according to symptom severity. Mild symptoms (n = 118) were defined as New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score (KCCQ-CSS) ≥ 80, and moderate to severe symptoms (n = 150) as NYHA class II/III/IV and KCCQ-CSS <80. Primary endpoint was change in peak oxygen uptake (pVO2) from baseline to Week 24; secondary endpoints included change in NYHA class, KCCQ-CSS, outflow tract gradients, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP).  RESULTS: In aficamten-treated patients, change at Week 24 was not different between moderate to severe (1.8 mL/kg/min; n = 71) and mild (1.6 mL/kg/min; n = 62) symptom groups (P = .8). Likewise, the change in secondary endpoints (NYHA class, resting or Valsalva gradients, and NT-proBNP) did not differ significantly between the two symptom groups. Both groups experienced statistically significant improvements in KCCQ-CSS, but the extent of improvement was greater in the advanced symptom group (P = .02 for interaction). Treatment-emergent serious adverse events were infrequent in both groups.

41160182,"Real-World Effectiveness of Nirmatrelvir-Ritonavir in Preventing Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization: A Population-Based Cohort Study in the Province of Québec, Canada.","BACKGROUND: The nirmatrelvir-ritonavir has shown to reduce coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalization and death before the Omicron era, but updated real-world evidence studies are needed. The current study aimed to assess whether nirmatrelvir-ritonavir reduces the risk of COVID-19-associated hospitalization among high-risk outpatients.  METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-infected outpatients between 15 March and 15 October 2022, using data from the Québec clinico-administrative databases. Propensity score matching was used to compare infected outpatients treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir with those not receiving nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. The relative risk (RR) of COVID-19-associated hospitalization occurring within 30 days following the index date was assessed using a Poisson regression.  RESULTS: A total of 14 756 treated outpatients were matched to controls. Regardless of vaccination status, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment was associated with a 74% reduced RR of hospitalization (RR, 0.26 [95% confidence interval [CI], .23-.29]; number needed to treat [NNT, 15). The effect was more pronounced in outpatients with an incomplete primary vaccination course (RR, 0.13 [95% CI, .08-.20]; NNT, 9). Benefit was also found in those with a complete primary vaccination course (RR, 0.28 [95% CI, .25-.32]; NNT, 17) regardless of age and the delay since the last vaccination. Subgroups analysis among high-risk outpatients with a primary vaccination course showed that nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment was associated with a significant decrease in the RR of hospitalization in severely immunocompromised outpatients (RR, 0.28 [95% CI, .21-.36]; NNT, 7), regardless of the delay since the last vaccination.

40946719,Osteoporosis.,"Osteoporotic fractures are one of the most common and consequential diseases of advanced ageing and many antifracture therapies are widely available but largely underused. This Seminar presents an updated approach to osteoporosis consultation, drawing upon published evidence and collaborative expert opinion to place the data in a pragmatic and useful context for clinicians. New evidence on osteoporosis screening recommendations, fracture-risk assessment, intervention decisions, nutrition-based therapies, and antiresorptive and anabolic therapies are discussed, along with practical approaches to treatment in the oldest old, those with chronic kidney disease, and patients who continue to fracture despite therapy. Patient safety is emphasised by providing an overview of advice on safe discontinuation of denosumab in those who require it.","Lancet (London, England)",Carrie Ye; Peter Ebeling; Gregory Kline,2025-10-25,10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01385-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40946719/,Endocrinology,,,Humans; Osteoporosis; Osteoporotic Fractures; Bone Density Conservation Agents; Denosumab; Risk Assessment; Female; Aged,Journal Article; Review,0,"This Seminar review article provides an updated approach to osteoporosis consultation, covering screening recommendations, fracture-risk assessment, intervention decisions, and both antiresorptive and anabolic therapies.

41128686,Foreign Combatants Wounded in Ukraine colonized by Extensively Drug-Resistant organisms: A Potential Source of Global Dissemination.,"BACKGROUND: Human conflicts are associated with increased prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). Here, we investigate a collection of extensively drug resistant (XDR) bacteria recovered from foreign combatants wounded in Ukraine and evacuated to a U.S. military treatment facility (MTF) in Germany between November 2022 and March 2024.  METHODS: As part of routine surveillance, perirectal swabs were collected upon admission from all patients arriving from outside Germany. Whole genome sequencing, antimicrobial resistance gene (AMR) carriage, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was determined for all isolates. Genetic relatedness to a set of isolates from soldiers treated at Ukrainian hospitals was assessed.  RESULTS: Eighty-six deduplicated clinically significant MDROs were cultured from 32 combatants from 10 countries injured in Ukraine and subsequently treated in Germany. Twenty-three (72%) patients carried isolates from well-established global lineages of Enterococcus faecium (ST117), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ST147, 395), Acinetobacter baumannii (ST78) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ST235, ST773) that harbored carbapenemase (IMP, NDM, OXA), a 16S rRNA methyltransferase (ArmA, RmtB, RmtC), and/or the van operon, with 14 patients having >1 of these organisms. Sixteen combatants carried isolates genetically related to those from Ukrainian patients, suggesting acquisition occurred in Ukraine. AST revealed multiple isolates non-susceptible to cefiderocol (n=8) or aztreonam-avibactam (n=6), further complicating treatment options for carbapenemase producing organisms.  CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study describing the epidemiology of MDROs collected from a population of foreign combatants injured in Ukraine. The findings forecast challenges to clinicians and infection prevention and control both in Ukraine and foreign healthcare systems as combatants are repatriated.",The Journal of infectious diseases,Patrick Mc Gann; Ting L Luo; Melissa J Martin; Henry D Dao; Valentyn Kovalchuk; Viacheslav Kondratiuk; Iryna Kovalenko; Brandon J Plaza; Joanna M Kettlewell; Cole P Anderson; Jason R Smedberg; Ana C Ong; Rosslyn Maybank; Yoon I Kwak; Joshua S Hawley-Molloy; Francois Lebreton; Jason W Bennett,2025-10-23,10.1093/infdis/jiaf538,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41128686/,Infectious diseases,,A. baumannii; E. coli; K. pneumoniae; P. aeruginosa; MDR; XDR; carbapenemase; outbreak,,Journal Article,0,"This surveillance study of 32 foreign combatants wounded in Ukraine and evacuated to Germany identified 86 extensively drug-resistant organisms, with 72% of patients carrying global lineages of carbapenemase-producing bacteria.
